# collapsible element

## Expected Behavior
1. When the user clicks the the expand button, the div should expand to reveal the description in the container.
2. When the user clicks again, the div should collapse just to show the header and button again.

## Hints
Remember google searches are your friend, so is chatgpt/gemini as long as you understand the output before using it.
1. Load the CSS file, how can you check it's loaded?
2. Load the javascript file in the html file, How could you check that it's been properly loaded? Don't forget the `defer` keyword otherwise the javascript will run before the DOM is loaded.
3. Attach an event listener to the button. How could you check that it runs when the user clicks?
4. In the event handler, toggle the presence of the `collapse` class, remember you can use `classList.toggle('collapse)`.
