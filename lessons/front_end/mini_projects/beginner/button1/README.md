Remember google searches are your friend, so is chatgpt/gemini as long as you understand the output before using it.
1. Load the javascript file in the html file, How could you check that it's been properly loaded? Don't forget the `defer` keyword otherwise the javascript will run before the DOM is loaded.
2. Attach an event listener to the button. How could you check that it runs when the user clicks?
3. In the event handler, toggle the dark-mode class of the body element (have a look whats already in the css file). `.classList.toggle` may be useful to you.
